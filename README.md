# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland

### Overview

- Intro
- Technologies
- Future work

**Intro**

This project is fully responsive and suitable for all devices from a screen width of 1280px to 320px.

**Technologies**

My previous project was not responsive and only fit on laptop screens. In this project I used relative values ​​instead of absolute values, grid layout and media queries which made all the difference.

**Future work**

I think technically it will be an interesting challenge to add animation to the site which will be responsive and will fit any screen from 1280px to 320px.

To do this I intend to use the same technologies I used in this responsive project, but in a way that is compatible with live content like animation.
